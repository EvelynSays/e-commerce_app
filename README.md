# My API Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the API documentation for our project. This README will guide you on how to view and interact with the API documentation using Swagger UI or other tools.

## Viewing the API Documentation

To view and interact with the API documentation, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Use Swagger UI

1. **Open the Swagger UI**: Visit the [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) website.

2. **Load Your OpenAPI Specification**:
   - Click on the **"Explore"** button.
   - In the **"Explore"** dialog, enter the URL where your OpenAPI YAML file is hosted. This could be a public URL or a raw GitHub URL (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/your-repo/main/docs.yaml`).
   - Click **"Explore"** to load the specification into Swagger UI.

### Option 2: Use an External API Documentation Service

You can also use other API documentation tools that support OpenAPI specifications. Here’s how:

1. **Visit a Documentation Service**:
   - [Redoc](https://redocly.com/redoc/)
   - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

2. **Upload Your OpenAPI YAML File**:
   - Follow the service’s instructions to upload or link to your OpenAPI YAML file. You may need to sign up or log in to use these services.

### Option 3: Local Swagger UI

If you prefer to view the API documentation locally, you can set up Swagger UI on your local machine:

1. **Download Swagger UI**: Download the [Swagger UI distribution](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) from GitHub.

2. **Set Up Swagger UI Locally**:
   - Extract the downloaded files.
   - Place your `docs.yaml` file in the same directory as `index.html` or adjust the path accordingly.

3. **Edit `index.html`**:
   - Open `index.html` in a text editor.
   - Find the section where the `SwaggerUIBundle` is initialized and update the `url` parameter to point to your `docs.yaml` file:
     ```html
     const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
       url: "docs.yaml",
       dom_id: '#swagger-ui',
       ...
     });
     ```

4. **Open `index.html`**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to view your API documentation.

## Example Usage

For example, if your OpenAPI YAML file is hosted at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/your-repo/main/docs.yaml`, you can load it into Swagger UI by entering this URL into the Swagger UI explore dialog.
